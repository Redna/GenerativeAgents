    "# Foundation of Generative Agents Conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "[Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf) is the foundation for this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem: \n",
    "The language model should act as **only** one character. It seems that the standard version of \n",
    "tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct is not that good in prompting exactly one thing. For the simulation\n",
    "it is crucial as the conversation of two agents should include the memory of each. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Solutions\n",
    "Several approaches are possible to tackel this: \n",
    "* Finetuning all parameters of the model seems to be pretty computational heavy and problemitic with the 24 GB VRAM on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)[https://github.com/huggingface/peft] for:\n",
    "* Prompt tuning or\n",
    "* Prefix tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will enable to run the 3rd option to finetune the model using prefix tuning. It allows adaption of the same model for different set of task. The goal is to create a model which can tackle the problem of not being able to converse as exactly one actor. \n"
